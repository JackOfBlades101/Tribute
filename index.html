     <div id=lyrics>

      <p>If your heart is in tune</p>
      <p>If you're melted in some groove</p>
      <p>If you do what it takes but no one dances your beat</p>
      <p>Life is a knife without handle going hand-to-hand</p>
      <p>If you only feel alive being in someone else's mind</p>
      <p> If you do, . </p>
      <p>If your heart is in tune</p>
      <p>If you feel life's a groove</p>
      <p>If think love's a whip, don't you ruin my skin</p>
      <p>Love is a telephone ringing in empty rooms</p>
      <p>Like if you only exists,</p>
      <p>When someone thinks on you</p>
      <p>If you do,</p>
      <p>If you are ono or you are two,</p>
      <p>If you are right or wrong</p>
      <p>Life is a whip don't you ruin my skin</p>
      <p>If your heart is out of tune</p>
      <p>If you dance with some groove</p>
      <p>Like if you only feel alive,</p>
      <p>Expanding somebody's life</p>
      <p>If you do</p>
      <p>If you're right or you're wrong</p>
      <p>If you live for goal</p>
